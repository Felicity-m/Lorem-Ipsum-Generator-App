# Lorem-Ipsum-Generator-App

This is a React JS app that generates lorem ipsum paragraphs. When a user types a number into the input field, it generates lorem ipsum paragraphs of that number onSubmit. The length of the lorem Ipsum data I used is 8, so users can only from zero to eight numbers. The input field has a type of number, hence, it only recieves numbers and not texts. The app is built with the useState hook.
